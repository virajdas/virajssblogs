            <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5">
                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <p>It was a stunning view when I first saw the reef from my hotel. The water, glimmering from the reflection of the bright sun. The warm breeze, blowing on my face as the fish species began to call to me. The Great Barrier Reef in all its 2900 individual reefs and 900 islands called to me. Before I knew it, here I was on a reef tour, my hands touching the very ocean that every coral lives within. Grabbing my scuba gear, I fearlessly dived into a world of another kind. A world where all the problems fade away like dust caught on the wind. I submerged deeper into the azure waters anxious of my findings.</p>
                        <p>Swimming deeper and deeper I left the world behind me. I eventually came across a tiny Australian clownfish calling himself Marlin and as I journeyed farther down, he accompanied me asking if I had seen his son Nemo. With a sorrow face I told him I hadn’t seen Nemo; it was a huge reef after all. The Great Barrier Reef stretches over 344,400 square kilometers and can be seen from space! Marlin swam away with an upside-down smile and knowing I couldn’t help him, I continued my journey.</p>
                        <p>We eventually made it down to the sea floor and I was greeted by a sight to remember. Colorful coral in all directions sang songs to me as if to greet me to this natural wonder. From within these coral in colors of bright pink and mauve, small fish poured out of each coral. Some were Gobies & Clownfish, while others were Angelfish & Parrotfish. They all came out greet me. My eyes still adjusting to the bright colors and beautiful fish turned to the oxygen level meter.</p>
                        <p>The meter reading the word, “OXYGEN LEVELS CRITICAL” sent my heart into panic. The tank on my back had been leaking valuable air. My focus diverted from the beauty of the moment to the meters and bars showing the suit statistics. In pure panic I attempted to stabilize the leak, but I just made it worse. I called the tour for help until I realized the small screen reading, “COMS ARE DOWN: TRYING TO RECONNECT” I was alone! </p>
                        <p>Suddenly a patch of sunshine penetrated the water and created a mystic glow. Giving hope to all who are lost (ME), it guided me to the surface a split second before the oxygen meter’s alarms rang. Knowing my adventure was over I returned the scuba gear and said my goodbyes to the largest nature build structure in the world.</p>
