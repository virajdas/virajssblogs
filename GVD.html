                        <p><i>Do you truly understand the pain? The pain of heat? The pain of loneliness?</i></p>
                        <p>It was, what feels like years ago, when a young city boy was just one of the 5.4 million people living in Sydney, Australia. He was small part of a big world. Every day, when he went home, that young boy would lie in his dusty bed, thinking. Thinking about adventure. Thinking about something different. Ha, he never should have wanted it! Now here I am, trapped in an endless desert. 163,115 square miles of pure desert. </p>
                        <p>I wandered too far, wanted adventure too much, and now this is life. Walking endlessly through sand dunes in colors of red, stony plains, and dry lakes of salt. Arid climates with temperatures of 60 – 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter is my everyday life now. I made a choice. I chose to leave everything I ever had behind to experience the Great Victoria Desert firsthand, and now I fear it is far too late to turn back. I may still be young, I may still be passionate, but I’m afraid all hope is lost. I fell to my knees. I fell to the heat. </p>
                        <p>Suddenly, from the desert sands, a figure emerged. He spoke the word, “BELIEVE!!!” Immediately he faded away as a small sandstorm began. From small, it grew to medium and from medium to large. Soon the sandstorm was beyond anything I’ve ever experienced. I was surrounded by flying particles shooting directly toward me. All I could do was run, so I did. I ran as fast as I could, faster than I ever believed I could. </p>
                        <p>I halted. Too tired to walk, too tired to speak.  I just stood there with the sand swirling around me. I collapsed to the ground below me. My eyes closed, hoping for a miracle. I then remembered what the man said, but what could believe mean? Moments later I got it! I had to believe a miracle would happen. Suddenly the sand around me started to blow harder and harder, but this time it felt different. This time, it felt like hope. I looked at the sky above my head. It happened, a miracle! The sand around me was driven by a rescue helicopter. I was saved. I immediately heard a familiar voice; it was the man from before. He was the pilot of the helicopter. He said, “You brought hope back and believed in a better future. You just had to do it all along!” He dropped down a ladder and as I boarded the flying vehicle, I thanked him for his help. </p>
                        <p>Hope can never be lost. It can just be weakened. That day changed my life. I added a positive outlook on all my future ventures and as for the man, I never saw him again, but I will assume he is still out there, bringing hope to those who need it. </p>
