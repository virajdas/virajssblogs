                        <p>I have always heard stories of it. The monolith that lay in a great desert of heat. I heard that it is 2831 ft above water level, and I heard that it is 3.33 square kilometers. The people around me describe the view as astonishing. I just had to see it myself. That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. What sights will I see, what makes it so magical? Why should I go? At first light I made my leave. The sun, just arising, illuminated my path toward what is known to silence the problems of your past. Walking through the woods, I made my way to the city.  </p>
                        <p>As I walked down the streets of this town, I met a man, an old man, offering tours of a place he calls Ayers Rock. Wondering what Ayers Rock was, I asked the man, “Can you take me to Uluru?” I suppose he also didn’t understand. Standing in the center of the street, we both stood there, without an understanding of one another's statements. In a moment's notice he pulled out the magical glowing rectangle from his pocket and started to click the letters on the glowing part. Suddenly the glowing part changed into a moving, glowing picture. The man pointed toward a massive rock, it was probably a monolith, “This is Ayers Rock, what is the Ulululuruh thingy?” I could tell he had terrible pronunciation of the native tongue. </p>
                        <p>“Uluru is a massive monolith in the center of the Great Victoria Desert. It is-” I tried to explain until I realized the Ayers Rock on the man's glow rectangle looked exactly as my people described Uluru as. I quickly understood that Ayers Rock was just another name for Uluru. I told the man I would be happy to go on his tour and within what seemed like 20 seconds, I was on a bus heading for my destiny. It was about 5.5 hours from Alice Springs to Uluru and within the first 2 hours I was already screaming to the old man, “WHEN WILL WE GET THERE!” He would always calm me down by distracting me, by pointing to random things outside such as a random bush. He would make everything sound so important. </p>
                        <p>Within another few hours we made it...to the Uluru Sunset Viewing Area. I asked the old man, “Can’t we go to the actual rock?” The old man simply shook his head and walked away. There I was surrounded by people who dared not cross the fence. Wondering why, I crossed the barrier and entered sacred land. Making the rest of the way on foot, I arrived at the base of the monolith. It was then when I once again met the old man, except this time, he appeared from a puff of smoke and fire. He spoke, “It is against the laws to climb Ayers Rock.” Ignoring him I began climbing as I looked back, he vanished into thin air once again. I climbed and climbed and climbed, until I could climb no longer. Tired, I looked down and to my surprise I was being chased by two policemen and a mysterious hooded figure. </p>
                        <p>The fear gave me the extra adrenaline I needed to make my way to the top. I turned to look at the view, but the look turned to an endless gaze. The lights flashing in my eyes, the colors flowing like paint. I felt alive. The view was nothing like my people described, it was far greater than anything I had ever seen, ever imagined. Suddenly I was grabbed by the two officers and dragged to the bottom of the monolith. My next sight shook me to my core. Beneath the hood of the hooded figure wasn’t who I expected it to be. I expected the old man, but it wasn’t. It was............. (Connection Lost) …........... </p>
